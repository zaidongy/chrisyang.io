# Hey, I'm Chris 👋

I help enterprises turn ServiceNow from a ticketing system into a strategic platform. Currently building AI-powered workflows at **PayPal** and trying not to break things (too badly).

---

## My Journey

I started in IT service management like many do—tickets, incidents, the usual firefighting. But I kept seeing the same pattern: companies buy ServiceNow, implement the basics, and leave 80% of the platform's potential completely untouched.

That bugged me. So I went deep. Architecture, integrations, automation—figuring out how to make this platform actually *work* for the business instead of against it.

A few years and several enterprise implementations later, I found myself at PayPal leading our **Now Assist** AI initiatives. Still nerding out on the platform, just with bigger challenges and higher stakes.

> *"Architecture isn't just about technical decisions—it's about enabling business outcomes while keeping the platform maintainable for the next engineer who inherits it."*

## What I Do

These days, I focus on three things:

**🏗️ Platform Architecture** — Designing ServiceNow implementations that won't need a complete rewrite in 18 months. I think about scale, maintainability, and that poor soul who has to debug my code at 2 AM.

**🤖 AI & Automation** — Leading PayPal's Now Assist rollout. Making AI actually useful for real users, not just demo-friendly. It's harder than the marketing makes it look.

**👨‍🏫 Knowledge Sharing** — Because the platform is only as good as the people using it. I write here, mentor internally, and believe in elevating the whole ServiceNow community. We're all figuring this out together.

## Beyond the Platform

**🎾 Tennis** — Currently recovering from a torn Achilles (Christmas 2025—absolutely *perfect* timing). Living in a boot, counting down the days until I can chase down lobs again. Summer 2026, I'm coming for you.

**🏂 Snowboarding** — Every winter, I'm chasing powder. A friend introduced me to it a few years back and now I'm completely hooked. Nothing beats fresh tracks on a bluebird day with good friends.

**🎵 Music** — EDM and trance, mostly. **Giuseppe Ottaviani** is my go-to—something about repetitive beats with beautiful melodies just clicks with how my brain works. Also into **Elderbrook**. If you have recommendations, send them my way.

**📍 Life** — Based in Henderson, NV with my fiancée Ashley. Yes, I moved here for no state income tax. No, I don't regret it. We're planning a 2027 wedding and currently in that fun "everything is booked out" phase of venue hunting.

**📺 Currently Watching** — Beast Games (Prime), slowly catching up on Jujutsu Kaisen, and whatever Netflix recommends during recovery.

## What I'm Up To Now

- 🏥 **Recovering:** 2+ months post-Achilles surgery, getting around on an iWalk
- 💍 **Planning:** 2027 wedding with Ashley—venue hunting is *intense*
- 🤖 **Building:** Now Assist implementations at PayPal
- 🎾 **Missing:** Tennis, badly. Physical therapy starts soon
- 🏂 **Dreaming:** Next snowboarding trip once I'm mobile again
