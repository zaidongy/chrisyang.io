# What I'm Doing Now

*Last updated: February 11, 2026*

This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about) — a snapshot of what's currently occupying my time and attention.

---

## 💼 Work

**Leading Now Assist implementations at PayPal.** We're rolling out AI-powered features across multiple ServiceNow applications. Current focus:

- Configuring AI Search with our knowledge bases
- Training the AI on our specific terminology and workflows
- Measuring adoption and iterating based on user feedback
- Building the business case for expanded AI features

It's challenging, exciting, and occasionally frustrating — exactly what I signed up for.

## 🏥 Health & Recovery

**Achilles tendon recovery — 2+ months post-surgery.**

- Still non-weight-bearing in the boot
- Using an iWalk for mobility (highly recommend if you're in the same boat)
- Physical therapy starts next week
- Goal: Back on the tennis court by summer 2026

The hardest part isn't the physical limitation — it's the mental game. Watching friends play tennis and snowboard while I'm sidelined is brutal. But I'm trying to use this time productively.

## 💍 Personal

**Wedding planning with Ashley.** We're targeting 2027 and currently:

- Touring venues (everything's booked so far out!)
- Figuring out our vision — somewhere between "intimate" and "actually invite our friends"
- Trying not to stress about details 18 months out

Also, house hunting in Orange County. We're ready to move back to California — closer to family, better neighborhoods, and yes, state income tax again. Worth it.

## 📚 Learning

- **Now Assist AI capabilities** — Deep diving into the technical architecture and configuration options
- **ServiceNow Vancouver features** — Keeping up with the latest platform capabilities
- **AI/ML fundamentals** — Understanding the underlying tech, not just the ServiceNow implementation

---

## 🎧 Consuming

- **Music:** Giuseppe Ottaviani's *Horizons* album on repeat. Also exploring Elderbrook's back catalog.
- **Podcasts:** All-In Podcast (weekly), various ServiceNow community podcasts
- **Reading:** Wall Street Journal daily, catching up on platform documentation
- **Watching:** Beast Games (Prime), slowly making progress on Jujutsu Kaisen

---

## 🎯 Goals for This Quarter

1. **Launch Now Assist pilot** at PayPal with measurable adoption metrics
2. **Publish 3 ServiceNow posts** on this site (starting with Anti-Patterns)
3. **Start physical therapy** and see real progress on recovery
4. **Book a wedding venue** (the big domino that makes other decisions easier)
5. **Snowboard at least once** before the season ends (doctor permitting)

---

## 📝 What's Next

- Building out this site with more ServiceNow content
- Speaking at a ServiceNow meetup or SNUG (if they accept my proposal)
- Getting back to tennis — even if it's just light rallying by summer
